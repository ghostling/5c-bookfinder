# CS133 Final Project: 5C Book Finder
By Jiexi Cao and Maury Quijada

## About
We created this application for the students at the Claremont Colleges: Harvey
Mudd College, Pomona College, Scripps College, Pitzer College, and Claremont
McKenna College. The aim of this application is to replace the use of 
spreadsheets and Facebook groups for selling books across the colleges as they
are disorganized and not very effective. We hope that our application provides
a clean, user-friendly experience for students who want to get rid of their old
books and buy used books from other students without paying the steep prices at
the local book store.

## How to Contribute
As we are still finishing up polishing this application, we would love to have
you join us. The only criteria to contribute to this project is to be a current
student at the Claremont Colleges. Contact Jiexi or Maury.
